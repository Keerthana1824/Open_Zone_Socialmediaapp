# OpenZone Social Media App

I created Openzone, a social media app using React, Material UI, and Firebase. Users can log in with Google, create posts with a title and description, and interact with others' posts by liking or unliking them. Simple and fun! Check out my code on GitHub and explore the app at the provided URL!

## Tech Stacks

- **React**
- **Material UI**
- **TypeScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Firebase**

## Purpose

This project was built to dive deeper into the concepts of React Hooks, component creation, and to practice and learn more about React Libraries, producing an interactive application.

## Features

- **Google Authentication**: Secure and easy login with Google accounts.
- **Create Posts**: Users can create posts with a title and description.
- **Interact with Posts**: Users can like or unlike posts created by others.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be fully responsive and user-friendly on all devices.

## Firebase Integration

A significant part of this project involves Firebase to manage the backend:

- **Firestore Database**: Used for storing and retrieving posts.
- **Google Authentication**: Provides a secure authentication method for users.
- **Hosting and Deployment**: The app is deployed using Firebase Hosting.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Keerthana1824/Openzone.git

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
