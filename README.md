#OpenZone Social Media App

I created Openzone, a social media app using React, Material UI, and Firebase. Users can log in with Google, create posts with a title and description, and interact with others' posts by liking or unliking them. Simple and fun! Check out my code on GitHub and explore the app at the provided URL!

Tech Stacks

1. React
2. Material UI
3. TypeScript
4. HTML
5. CSS
6. Firebase

This project was build to dive deeper into the concept of React Hooks, component creation and to practice and learn more about React Libraries and produce an interactive application. 

A bit of Material UI is involved to make it a bit more presentable and a Lot of Firebase intrusion is made sure with the FireStore Database and Google Authentication offered by FireBase and Deployment of the project.
